# busputer

The BusPuter project is an bus based bord computer for cars.

This Project based on an Adafruit Feather M0 with a Atmel 32Bit ARM CPU and additional a SIM808 based module. 
To communicate with the BusPuter we use the [BLYNK](http://www.blynk.cc) Project and the [TinyGSM](https://github.com/vshymanskyy/TinyGSM) libary.
As display we use the [U8G2](https://github.com/olikraus/u8g2) libary to support some displays.

Following functions are integrated:
* Time vie GPS
* Speed via GPS
* Position tracking via Blynk (GPRS)
*
